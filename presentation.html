## GivenGain?

--
* Non-profit foundation, since 2001

???

Allows charities anywhere in the world to accept donations from anywhere in the world

--
* One of the first crowdfunding platforms on the web

--
* Simplified the platform over the years, heavily CGI.pm based

???

Used to have things like CMS, blogging, hosting, etc

--
* Rewritten to Mojolicious/Moose/DBIx::Class in 2014/2015

--
* Events are a recent feature on the platform

???

Added in 2018

---

## [Events](https://www.givengain.com/e/126th-boston-marathon/)

<img width=750px src="img/boston_126.png" />

???

Describe how events work

---

## 2020 ...

???

Then 2020 happened

--
* Lockdowns

--
* [Virtual events](https://www.givengain.com/e/vhi-virtual-event/) became a thing

--
* Streaming became [much more popular](https://twitchtracker.com/statistics):

<img width=750px src="img/twitch.png" />

???

---

## Twitch?

--
* Or in general: Livestreaming

--
* Often gaming content

--
* Streams can go on for hours

--
* Some are like modern day Telethons

???

https://gamesdonequick.com/ - 5 day event, 24hrs a day, raises several million every year

--
* They want tools to visualise fundraising progress and goals

???

## [Widgets!](https://www.givengain.com/widget/livestream/stats_widget?initiative_id=2550)

<div id="wrap">
<iframe
	id="scaled-frame"
	src="https://www.givengain.com/widget/livestream/stats_widget?initiative_id=2550"
	title="126th Boston Marathon"
	scrolling="no"
></iframe>
</div>

???

This is a general overview of an event, the totals here will update dynamically

---

## [More Widgets!](https://www.givengain.com/widget/livestream/donation_alert?initiative_id=2550)

<div id="wrap">
<iframe
	id="scaled-frame"
	src="https://www.givengain.com/widget/livestream/donation_alert?initiative_id=2550"
	title="126th Boston Marathon"
	scrolling="no"
></iframe>
</div>

???

This one (which may currently be a blank page) is for individual donations, and can be used in livestreams

Maybe. if. i. talk. slow. enough. a. donation. might. appear...

## [Our Beta Tester](https://www.givengain.com/ap/grant-hinds-raising-funds-for-new-hope-sa-36848/)

<div id="video">
<video
	height="400"
	controls

<source src="video/Grant_Hinds.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video> 
</div>

???

Grant Hinds.

ZA based streamer who helped us test the first release of the livestreaming widget(s), which have changed a little since then

---

## Not Just For Livestreaming

<img width=600px src="img/boston_widgets.jpg" />

???

Using them at the Boston Marathon last year to show running totals.

---

## How Does This All Work?

Essentially:

--
* Browser connects to Mojolicious server (via load balancer)

--
* Connection is upgraded to a websocket

--
* Mojolicious opens a consumer connection to RabbitMQ

--
* Messages (elsewhere) are pushed to the message queue

--
* Consumer websocket receives the JSON message payload

--
* HTML DOM dynamically updated to reflect message content

???

The key thing is

--
* No refresh of the page required

---

## Browser

* https://www.givengain.com/widget/livestream/donation_alert?initiative_id=2550

--
* Some HTML and JavaScript, opens wss://www.givengain.com/ws/donation_alert/initiative/2550

--
* Reads the returned JSON to update the DOM for each message received

--

```
$ wscat --connect wss://www.givengain.com/ws/donation_alert/initiative/2550

Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)

<   {
	"currency":{"code":"USD","symbol":"US$"},
	"donation_amount":"60",
	"donor_image":"/content_members/images/profiles/423845-BQMJDU_144x144.jpg",
	"donor_name":"John Smith",
	"entity":null,
	"id":null,
	"message":"You are amazing and truly inspirational ❤️ -I’m proud of you!"
	}

```

## Mojolicious

---

## Mojolicious

```perl
# ->recurring returns an identifier we can use to remove it later.
# 3 seconds seems a reasonable amount of time to loop here - we
# need a balance between an "immediate" update and not putting too
# much load on the server (imagine if we have thousands of these?)
*$ioloop = Mojo::IOLoop->recurring( 3 => sub {

    if ( $RabbitMQ->mq->is_connected ) {

        # -1 on recv for non-blocking, we can't block here as it
        # would defeat the object of doing event looping
        while ( my $message = $RabbitMQ->mq->recv(-1) ) {
            my $ws_message = $c->_get_ws_message_from_body(
                $widget_type, $message, $entity_type, $entity
            );
            $c->send( $json_encoder->encode( $ws_message ) ) if $ws_message;
        }
    } else {
        $c->app->log->debug( "not connected to queue" );
    }
} );

Mojo::IOLoop->start unless Mojo::IOLoop->is_running;
```

???

note comment about 3 seconds

## Mojolicious

# 3 seconds seems a reasonable amount of time to loop here - we
# need a balance between an "immediate" update and not putting too
# much load on the server (imagine if we have thousands of these?)
$ioloop = Mojo::IOLoop->recurring( 3 => sub {

    if ( $RabbitMQ->mq->is_connected ) {

*        # -1 on recv for non-blocking, we can't block here as it
*        # would defeat the object of doing event looping
*        while ( my $message = $RabbitMQ->mq->recv(-1) ) {
            my $ws_message = $c->_get_ws_message_from_body(
                $widget_type, $message, $entity_type, $entity
            );
            $c->send( $json_encoder->encode( $ws_message ) ) if $ws_message;
        }
    } else {
        $c->app->log->debug( "not connected to queue" );
    }
} );

Mojo::IOLoop->start unless Mojo::IOLoop->is_running;
```

???

note -1 recv for non-blocking

if we get a message we send it up the websocket

then we repeat the IOLoop

---

## RabbitMQ?

--
* Message broker we're using in various systems (async jobs, batch processing, etc)

???

sending emails, generating PDFs, running reports, etc

--
* Traditionally:
 * Messages are delivered to queues on a topic exchange via routing keys
 * One queue can have many consumers bound to it
 * **Each message is consumed by one (and only one) consumer**
 * Allows massively parallel processing

--

* With livestreaming widgets:
 * Messages are delivered to a "fanout" exchange
 * One exchange can have many queues bound to it
 * **Each message is delivered to every queue bound to the exchange**

???

Demonstrate differences using PROD monitoring graphs

This is an entire talk itself, I won't go into the detail too much

--

* Using Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ with our own shim

???

The shim just sets up the connection/queues/exchanges/etc

---

## RabbitMQ?

```perl
sub publish {
    my ($self, $payload, $queue, $routing_key, $priority, $publish_props) = @_;

    $publish_props //= {};

    if ( $self->exchange_type eq 'fanout' ) {

        # if fanout we just publish to an exchange and rabbitmq will
        # push the messages onto every queue in the exchange
        $self->mq->publish(
            $self->channel,
            $routing_key, # supplied but will be ignored
            $payload,
            {
                # we're publising to an *exchange* here, not a queue and
                # this is an important difference when calling ->publish
                # as we *don't* bind to a queue first
                exchange => $self->exchange,
            },
            $publish_props
        );

        ....
    }

    ...
```

???

The shim here will DTRT depending on how the object was instantiated

---

## Lessons Learned / Gotchas?

* Beware autoscailing

???

Probably your widget logic should include some reconnection handling

Our loadbalancer proxies wss:// requests to a particular instance

--
* RabbitMQ "just works"

???

but beware the high/low water marks

--
* We haven't really used this at scale yet

--
* Mojo::RabbitMQ::Client is broken:

```
commit 50788bc1b145c466ddcae14e2d1c90b8d7284d45
Author: Lee Johnson <lee@givengain.ch>
Date:   Tue Mar 24 14:25:03 2020 +0100

    websockets + rabbitmq to update the donation widget

    ...

    note that we are using our own wrapper around RabbitMQ here (the model
    class) combined to Mojo::IOLoop as attempting to use the
    Mojo::RabbitMQ::Client module resulted in about 2 days of hacking and
    frustration with no success - it appears to be broken and this was
    confirmed by checking out the repo and trying the examples
```
